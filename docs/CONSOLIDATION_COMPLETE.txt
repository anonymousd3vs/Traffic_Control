🎯 NEXT STEPS:

   OPTION 1 - Use Cleanup Script (Recommended):
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   python cleanup_unwanted_files.py
   
   This will:
   • Delete entire recent_changes_docs/ folder
   • Ask about optional duplicate signal files
   • Show summary

   OPTION 2 - Manual Deletion:
   ──────────────────────────
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "recent_changes_docs"

✨ BENEFITS AFTER CLEANUP:

   BEFORE:
   • 30+ doc files in recent_changes_docs/
   • Navigation difficult
   • Project status unclear
   • ~75% completion indicated
   
   AFTER:
   • 0 progress docs (consolidated)
   • Clear, organized structure
   • Project status explicit
   • 95% completion documented ✓
   • Production-ready marked ✓
