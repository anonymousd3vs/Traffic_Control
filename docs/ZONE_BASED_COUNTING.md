# Zone-Based Vehicle Counting

## Overview

The system now uses **intelligent zone-based counting** instead of line-crossing when lane filtering is enabled.

## What Changed?

### Old Approach: Line Crossing Method

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│                                │
│     Vehicles detected          │
│     everywhere                 │
│                                │
│  ══════════════════════════    │ ← Yellow counting line
│                                │
│     More vehicles              │
│                                │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Problem:
❌ Line crossing doesn't make sense with zone filtering
❌ Visual clutter with unnecessary line
❌ Less intuitive
```

### New Approach: Zone-Based Counting

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│                                │
│     ┌──────────────┐           │
│     │              │  ← Enter  │
│     │   Green      │           │
│     │   Zone       │           │
│     │   (Lane)     │  ← Track  │
│     │              │           │
│     │              │  ← Count  │
│     └──────────────┘           │
│                                │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Benefits:
✅ Vehicles counted after moving through zone
✅ No counting line needed
✅ Clean visual interface
✅ More intuitive behavior
```

## How It Works

### Zone-Based Counting Algorithm

1. **Vehicle Enters Zone**
   - Vehicle detected inside the green lane polygon
   - Entry position (Y-coordinate) recorded
2. **Vehicle Tracked Through Zone**
   - Vehicle trajectory tracked as it moves
   - Movement direction analyzed (towards/away from camera)
3. **Vehicle Counted**
   - After moving ≥50 pixels downward (towards camera)
   - Only counted once per vehicle
   - Direction filter ensures approaching vehicles only

### Code Logic

```python
# When vehicle enters zone
entry_y = vehicle.first_detection_y  # Record entry position

# Track movement
current_y = vehicle.current_position_y
movement = current_y - entry_y  # Positive = towards camera

# Count when significant movement through zone
if movement >= 50:  # 50 pixels threshold
    count_vehicle()
```

## Visual Changes

### What You'll See:

**With Lane Filtering (Zone Mode):**

- ✅ Green lane polygon (zone boundary)
- ✅ Vehicle bounding boxes inside zone only
- ✅ Colored trajectories showing movement
- ❌ NO counting line
- ℹ️ Status: "Mode: Zone-Based + Direction"

**Without Lane Filtering (Legacy Mode):**

- ✅ Yellow counting line across frame
- ✅ All vehicle detections
- ℹ️ Status: "Mode: Line-Based"

## Counting Behavior

### Zone-Based (Lane Enabled):

```
Vehicle appears at top of zone (Y=200)
  ↓
Moves through zone (Y=250, 300, 350...)
  ↓
Passes threshold (Y >= 200 + 50 = 250)
  ↓
COUNTED ✅ "Vehicle 5 counted in zone!"
  ↓
Continues through zone (not counted again)
  ↓
Exits zone
```

### Line-Based (No Lane):

```
Vehicle above line (Y=400)
  ↓
Moves downward
  ↓
Crosses line (Y=450)
  ↓
COUNTED ✅ "Vehicle 5 crossed the line!"
```

## Configuration

### Movement Threshold

The system counts vehicles after they move **50 pixels** downward through the zone. You can adjust this:

```python
# In ONNXVehicleTracker.__init__()
self.min_movement_to_count = 50  # Pixels
```

**Recommendations:**

- **Shorter zones:** 30-40 pixels
- **Standard zones:** 50 pixels (default)
- **Very long zones:** 60-80 pixels

### When Vehicles Are Counted

Zone-based counting requires:

1. ✅ Vehicle detected inside lane zone
2. ✅ Vehicle tracked for ≥5 frames
3. ✅ Vehicle moving towards camera (if direction filter enabled)
4. ✅ Vehicle moved ≥50 pixels downward from entry

## Benefits

### 1. More Intuitive

- **Zone = Counting Area** (no arbitrary line)
- Vehicles counted as they move through monitored area
- Matches real-world traffic monitoring concepts

### 2. Cleaner Interface

- No yellow line cluttering the view
- Just the green zone showing monitored area
- Professional appearance

### 3. Better Accuracy

- Counts vehicles that actually traverse the zone
- Prevents counting stationary/stopped vehicles
- Direction filter ensures correct direction

### 4. Flexible

- Works with any zone shape (straight, curved roads)
- Automatic adjustment to zone size
- No manual line positioning needed

## Statistics Display

### Panel Labels:

**Zone-Based Mode:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ DETECTION STATS     │
│ Active Objects: 5   │
│ Total in Zone: 23   │ ← Changed label
│ Mode: Zone-Based    │ ← Mode indicator
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Line-Based Mode:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ DETECTION STATS     │
│ Active Objects: 12  │
│ Total Crossed: 45   │ ← Original label
│ Mode: Line-Based    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Usage

### With Lane Configuration (Zone Mode):

```bash
# Configure lane
python lane_config_tool.py --video your_video.mp4

# Run with zone-based counting (automatic)
python final_tracking_onnx.py --source your_video.mp4 --output output.mp4
```

**Result:**

- Vehicles detected only in green zone
- Counted after moving through zone
- No counting line visible
- Status: "Zone-Based + Direction"

### Without Lane Configuration (Line Mode):

```bash
# Run without lane config
python final_tracking_onnx.py --source your_video.mp4 --output output.mp4
```

**Result:**

- All vehicles detected
- Counted when crossing yellow line
- Counting line visible
- Status: "Line-Based"

## Technical Details

### New Tracker Methods:

```python
def check_zone_counting(self, object_id) -> bool:
    """
    Zone-based counting method.
    Returns True if vehicle should be counted.
    """
    # Check if already counted
    if object_id in self.counted_ids:
        return False

    # Calculate movement through zone
    movement = current_y - entry_y

    # Count if moved significantly downward
    if movement >= self.min_movement_to_count:
        self.counted_ids.add(object_id)
        return True

    return False
```

### Backward Compatibility:

The old `check_line_crossing()` method is still available and used when lane filtering is disabled:

```python
if self.lane_enabled:
    # Use zone-based counting
    if self.tracker.check_zone_counting(obj_id):
        count_vehicle()
else:
    # Use line-crossing counting (legacy)
    if self.tracker.check_line_crossing(obj_id, line_y):
        count_vehicle()
```

## Comparison

### Zone-Based vs Line-Based:

| Feature             | Zone-Based            | Line-Based       |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Trigger**         | Lane config           | No lane config   |
| **Detection Area**  | Inside zone only      | Entire frame     |
| **Counting Method** | Movement through zone | Cross line       |
| **Visual Line**     | None                  | Yellow line      |
| **Threshold**       | 50 pixels movement    | Line crossing    |
| **Best For**        | Lane monitoring       | General counting |

## Console Output

### Zone-Based:

```
Lane configuration loaded: 6 points
Lane-based filtering ENABLED
Direction filtering ENABLED
...
Vehicle 0 counted in zone! Total: 1
Vehicle 2 counted in zone! Total: 2
Vehicle 5 counted in zone! Total: 3
```

### Line-Based:

```
Lane config not found. Lane filtering disabled.
...
Vehicle 0 crossed the line! Total: 1
Vehicle 3 crossed the line! Total: 2
Vehicle 7 crossed the line! Total: 3
```

## Summary

The zone-based counting approach provides:

1. **Cleaner Interface** - No counting line when using lane filtering
2. **Intuitive Behavior** - Zone = counting area
3. **Better Accuracy** - Counts vehicles that traverse the zone
4. **Automatic Mode** - Uses zone counting when lane is configured
5. **Backward Compatible** - Line crossing still works without lane config

**Result:** A more professional and intuitive traffic monitoring system! 🎯

---

**When to use each mode:**

- **Zone-Based:** Lane-specific monitoring (highways, specific lanes)
- **Line-Based:** General traffic counting (all lanes, no specific zone)

Both modes support direction filtering to count only vehicles approaching the camera.
